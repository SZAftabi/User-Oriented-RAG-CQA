# **Enhancing Reliability in Community Question Answering with an Expert-Oriented RAG System**
## üìú Abstract
<p align="justify">
In recent years, pre-trained large language models (LLMs) have become a cornerstone for automatically generating answers in question-and-answer (Q&A) communities, significantly reducing user wait times and improving response quality. However, these models require substantial computational resources and are prone to generating hallucinated or unreliable content. To overcome these limitations, we propose an advanced export-oriented Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework as a cost-effective and reliable alternative. Central to our approach is a user-aware question entailment recognition module, which leverages user modeling to identify archived questions with answers that fully or partially address the user's new query. This user modeling significantly improves retrieval relevance, resulting in reduced hallucination and enhanced answer quality. The framework synthesizes expert-written answers from similar questions to generate unified responses. Experimental results on the CQADupStack dataset show that our user-aware approach achieves a 3.6% improvement in ROUGE-1 over its user-agnostic counterpart. Both human and AI evaluations confirm the effectiveness of incorporating user modeling in minimizing hallucination and delivering high-quality, contextually appropriate answers‚Äîdemonstrating its potential for real-world Q&A systems.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Data
<p align="justify">
You can freely access the CQADupStack dataset through the following link:<br>
üëâ http://nlp.cis.unimelb.edu.au/resources/cqadupstack/ <br><br>
Follow the instructions below to use the corresponding data for each component of the proposed system:<br>
  <ul> <h3> 1. Tag Diversity Preprocessing </h3>
Extract questions and their corresponding tags from CQADupStack to handle tag diversity before performing user modeling.
  </ul>
  <ul> <h3> 2. Tag Generation </h3>
Use the file named <code>User-Profiler (TrainData)</code> to train the tag generation component of the user knowledge profiler.
You may evaluate the model using <code>User-Profiler (TestData)</code>.

<br><i>Example format:</i>
index | QuestionBody                                                                                                                   | tags
------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------

</ul>
<ul> <h3> 3. User Modeling </h3>
The file <code>UserHistory (TestData)</code> includes each user‚Äôs question history, allowing you to apply the fine-tuned model to generate user knowledge profiles based on past activity.

<br><i>Example format:</i>
index | userid | historyCount | historyIDs | history                                                                                       | forum
------|--------|--------------|------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------

</ul>
<ul> <h3> 4. Recognizing Question Entailment (RQE)</h3>
Use the data named <code>Post-retrieval (TrainData)</code> to fine-tune your LLaMA-2 model for the RQE task.
You may evaluate the model using <code>Post-retrieval (TestData)</code>.

<br> <i>Example format:</i>
index | id_Q1 | id_Q2  | q1                                                         | q2                                      | ... | entailment | U_Background_kn

The data contains the following columns: <br>
<i>index</i> (row number), <i>id_Q1, id_Q2</i> (question IDs), <i>q1, q2</i> (RQE questions), <i>body_Q1, body_Q2</i> (full question texts), <i>forum_x, forum_y</i> (forum names of Q1 and Q2), <i>dups_Q1, dups_Q2</i> (duplicate question IDs), <i>tags_Q1, tags_Q2</i> (associated tags), <i>title_Q1, title_Q2</i> (question titles), <i>userid_Q1, userid_Q2</i> (user IDs), <i>entailment</i> (label: Entailed / Not-entailed), <i>U_Background_kn</i> (user_1 knowledge profile)
</ul>
